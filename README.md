* cc-bmean project: https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos.git Source http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angularjs-patterns-clean-code

Also added is the angular-bootstrap module http://getbootstrap.com/

The bower components have been checked in to save time on initial setup. If everyone has bower installed they can be removed.
